# PowerBIProject- Analysis of Mental Health Status amongst College Students

##Introduction and Objectives
As college students navigate the challenges of academic pressures, social dynamics, and personal development, their mental health can significantly impact their well-being and academic performance. In this analysis, I delved into three critical areas of mental health: depression, anxiety, and panic attack. Understanding these conditions is essential not only for fostering a supportive environment but also for implementing effective solutions that will improve student mental health and overall success.
Objective: To study the effect of mental health conditions on student academic performance and derive recommendations that will help college management create an healthier academic environment.
